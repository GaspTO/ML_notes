**Read multiple passes:**
	1. title, abstract and figures. The figure often summarize the whole paper
	2. intro, conclusions and skim the rest
	(skip related work)
	3. read but skip the math
	4. read the whole thing but skip the parts that dont make sense. This last one is because some things that are written are not known whether they are important or not at the time. So, prioritize time if you're trying to read a lot of papers.
	
**Questions to keep in mind:**
	1. What did the authors try to accomplish?
	2. What were the key elements of the approach?
	3. What can you use yourself?
	4. What other references do you want to follow?
	
	
**Where to find the latest content:**
	1. twitter
	2. ML Subreddit
	3. NIPS, ICML, ICLR
	5. Arxiv Sanity
	4. People
	
**Papers with math:**
	Rederive it from scratch. - This is also useful to be able to do it on your own if you ever have an algorithm or piece of math you need to develop.
	
**Code:**
	Reimplement things from scratch if you really want to understand the algorithm.
	
**Overrall reading:**
	Better to read steadly than by bursts. A bit every week is better than reading 50 papers during thanksgiving.

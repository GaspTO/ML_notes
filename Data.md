# Vision
* **PACS** and other domain generalisation datasets require extrapolation beyond i.i.d. data per design by testing on a domain different from training data (e.g. cartoon images).
* **VLCS:** Birds
* Office-Home
* **ImageNet-A** is a collection of natural images that several state-of-the-art models consistently classify wrongly. It thus benchmarks models on worst-case natural images.
* **ImageNet-R** ImageNet-R(endition) contains art, cartoons, deviantart, graffiti, embroidery, graphics, origami, paintings, patterns, plastic objects, plush objects, sculptures, sketches, tattoos, toys, and video game renditions of ImageNet classes. ImageNet-R has renditions of 200 ImageNet classes resulting in 30,000 images.

### Corruptions
* **Imagenet-C** applies 15 different image corruptions to standard test images, an approach we find appealing for its variety and usability.

### Shape-Texture 
* **Cue Conflict Stimuli**

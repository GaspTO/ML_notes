Paper: [Performance-optimized hierarchical models predict neural responses in higher visual cortex](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1403112111)

# Overview

The summary of the paper: **A model with perfect neural predictivity in IT will necessarily exhibit high performance, because IT itself does. Here we demonstrate that the converse is also true within a biologically appropriate model class**. They explore a wide range of biologically plausible hierarchical neural network models and then assess them against measured IT and V4 neural response data. They show that there is a strong correlation between a modelâ€™s performance on a challenging high-variation object recognition task and its ability to predict individual IT neural unit responses.


## Evaluation
They collected some neurons response to certain images in the IT region of the brain. Then they make a linear regression using, as variables, the neurons of the network model and try to predict the firing of one particular real life neuron

In the previous figure, there seems to be a correlation between performance on the test set and correlation with the IT neurons firing. Which might be useful to use the firings as a validation method to see if it seems the model is doing well.

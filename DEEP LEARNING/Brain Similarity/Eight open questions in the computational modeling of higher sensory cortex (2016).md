# Overview
This paper reviews some of the past achievements in the area and describes 8 questions of interest in computational neuroscience. The overview of the past achievements is really good.

The bibliography of this paper is quite good.
# Questions
1. Why is IT cortex heterogenous at large spatial scales?
2. Which visual properties are explicitly encoded in intermediate ventral stream areas?
3. Can models predict the perceptual consequences of direct neural perturbations?
4. Is ‘linear readout’ a real model of downstream neural decoding?
5. How do feedforward discriminative networks connect to top-down inference in generative models?
6. How is visual learning actually implemented in the brain?
7. Can sensory systems beyond vision benefit from performance-driven neural-network approaches?
8. How should working memory be included? Beyond Sense-At-A-Glance

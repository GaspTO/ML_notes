# Overview
This paper collects two pieces of data and connects them using linear models.

First, it takes a bunch of humans and images and acesses their behaviour (categorization perfomance).

Second, it takes the same images and shows them to two monkeys and records neuronal activity in the V4 and IT area.

Lastly, it takes those neuronal signals and tries to teach several decoders to predict the behaviour of a human.

In the end, they find out that what they call "Laws of Rands IT" to be a very good predictor of human performance.



# Data
The data is available through the dicarlo lab platform (publicly available from the brain score platform).
